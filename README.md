**SPEECH-EMOTION-RECOGNITION**

This is simple project used to detect the emotion using voice . 
Here I have used my data and dataset from kaggle also. 
In the file *Speech_emotion.ipynb* at the end you will be getting output. The out is in th eform of the code of nthe dataset that is in prediction.csv file . Actually there was problem in detecting means with the lables because of too much dataset . 
Here you can record you voice too and detect the emotion of your voice by uploading it in the end of the code . In this I have shown my example at end in .ipynb file .
